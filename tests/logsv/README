This directory tree contains a unit test suite for LOG service. The goal is
to test the API extensively. Checking all possible error conditions etc.

From the ticket #1181, 3 new TCs have been added to the test suite:
- CCB Object Modify, data group. Group does not exist. Not allowed
- CCB Object Modify, data group. Group exists. OK
- CCB Object Modify, delete data group. OK

The second TC tries to set the data group to "log-data" group.
In order to help the TC passed, "log-data" group must be existing and be added
to supplementary group list of the user as which LOGSV is running.
Otherwise that TC will be skipped.
