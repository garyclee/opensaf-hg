This directory tree contains a unit test suite for LOG service. The goal is
to test the API extensively. Checking all possible error conditions etc.

From the ticket #1181, 3 new TCs have been added to the test suite:
- CCB Object Modify, data group. Group does not exist. Not allowed
- CCB Object Modify, data group. Group exists. OK
- CCB Object Modify, delete data group. OK

The second TC tries to set the data group to "log-data" group.
In order to help the TC passed, "log-data" group must be existing and be added
to supplementary group list of the user as which LOGSV is running.
Otherwise that TC will be skipped.


SET UP A CLUSTER 02 NODES WITH DIFFERENT CKPT VERSIONS
------------------------------------------------------
There was issue when two nodes runs with different ckpt versions.
Ticket #1459 is an example. How to setup this on UML?

Here is guideline for environment preparing for the case active logsv with version #5,
standby logsv with version #4.

1. Create 02 separate folders, one refers to branch 5.0.x (folder A),
   other one refers to 4.6.x branch (folder B).

2. Build OpenSAF and UML for them (refer to Wiki)

3. Open 2 terminals. On each one, change directory to ../tools/cluster_sim_uml

4. Start active node SC-1 with logsv version #5.
   cluster_sim_uml> ./opensaf nodestart 1

5. Start standby node SC-2 with logsv version #4
   cluster_sim_uml> ./opensaf nodestart 2

6. Wait for seconds to make sure all OpenSAF services come up.

7. Run test by `logtest` app with no option.

8. Observe both nodes if there is any issue (e.g: node is rebooted)

If want to test the case active logsv version #4, standby logsv version #5, reboot above SC-1 (swithover).
