WHAT IS THIS?

This directory (and subdirectories) contains a User Mode Linux - UML simulated
cluster environment.

The cluster environment is built using:
- Linux kernel
- Busybox
- a few host libraries

All packages are downloaded from the net. Make sure to have proxy settings
correct if needed. Downloaded packages are stored in the 'archive'
subdirectories.

For minimising the memory requirements for each UML instance, the major part of
its root file system consists of links to files on the host file system. This
concept is called a shadow root, see below.


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

$OSAF_UML_ARCHIVE   This directory contains downloaded source packages
                    (./archive/ used as default).

$OSAF_UML_BUILD/bin This directory contains the built binaries
                    (./bin/ used as default).

./bin               This directory contains a few scripts.

$OSAF_UML_CONFIGD   This directory contains configuration files
                    (./config/ used as default).

root_template       This directory contains the template for building initramfs
                    which is used as root file system.


HOW TO BUILD

- Execute './build_uml all' in this directory or './build_uml' in the parent
directory.

Building means downloading, configuring & building kernel and busybox packages
from the internet.

Files are downloaded to the directory pointed out by the $OSAF_UML_ARCHIVE
variable, or to "./archive" if not defined.

Files created are removed by 'clean_uml'. Downloaded files are removed manually
by deleting them from the archive.

Building adds the following directories under $OSAF_UML_BUILD:

root        This directory structure is used when building the initramfs for
            the kernel. It is created using the root_template and busybox
            binary.

linux-*     This directory contains the extracted linux kernel source package.

busybox-*   This directory contains the extracted busybox source package.

iproute2-*  This directory contains the extracted iproute2 source package.

uml_utilities_* This directory contains the extraed UML utilities
                source package.


HOW TO RUN

To start one UML instance in a shell:

   $OSAF_UML_BUILD/bin/linux

For each UML instance started, the PID of the main thread is saved in a PID file
in the user's home directory, i.e. ~/.uml/<xxx>/pid.


HOW TO CONFIGURE A CUSTOM KERNEL VERSION

To generate the kernel configuration file for a different kernel version, first
generate the default configuration file using the following command:

   make ARCH=um defconfig

Then add initramfs and TIPC to the configuration, e.g. using the menuconfig
command:

   make ARCH=um menuconfig


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

UML should run on any 3.x and 4.x host kernel.

GNU C Library version 2.14 or later
