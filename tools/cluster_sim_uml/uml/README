WHAT IS THIS?

This directory (and subdirectories) contains a User Mode Linux - UML simulated
cluster environment.

The cluster environment is built using:
- Linux kernel
- Busybox
- a few host libraries

All packages are downloaded from the net. Make sure to have proxy settings
correct if needed. Downloaded packages are stored in the 'archive'
subdirectories.

For minimising the memory requirements for each UML instance, the major part
of its root file system consists of links to files on the host file
system. This concept is called a shadow root, see below.


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

archive   This directory contains linux and busybox downloads.

bin	  This direcory contains the UML binary and a few scripts.

config    This directory contains linux and busybox configuration and
	  patches.

root_template	This directory contains the template for building initramfs 
		which is used as root file system.


HOW TO BUILD

- Edit the Environment.[bash|sh] file in parent directory to suit your 
  environment and requirements.

- Execute 'make all' in this directory or 'make all' in the parent directory.

Building means downloading, configuring & building kernel and busybox packages
from the internet.

Files created by make are removed by 'make clean'. Downloaded files are
removed by 'make realclean'.

Building adds the following direcories:

root	   This directory structure is used when building the initramfs for 
	   the kernel. It is created using the root_template and busybox
	   binary.

linux-*	   This directory contains the extracted linux kernel source package.

busybox-*   This directory contains the extracted busybox source package.

uml_utilities_*	This directory contains the extraed UML utilities
		source package.


HOW TO RUN

To start one UML instance in a shell:

   ./bin/linux

For each UML instance started, the PID of the main thread is saved in a PID
file in the user's home directory, i.e. ~/.uml/<xxx>/pid.


PERFORMANCE


Consider applying the SKAS3 patch to the host.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

UML should run on any 2.6 host kernel. If the host kernel is patched for SKAS3
mode, you will get better guest (UML) kernel performance.

GNU C Library version 2.4 or later
