WHAT IS THIS?

This directory contains a development environment for opensaf. It can be used
for building and testing SAF applications in a simulated UML based cluster.

Compile your application against the header files in the include subdir.

Link your application against the libraries in the lib subdir.

Add your application scripts and binaries in the subdirectories
root.controller and root.payload. Look for aishello to see how this can be done.

Edit the AMF configuration file to include your AMF application:
root.controller/etc/opt/opensaf/AppConfig.xml

After adding/removing any files in the root.* directories, run 'make all'. It
will regenerate the CPIO files used by the UML kernel when it boots.

To (cold) start the cluster:

   ./opensaf.sh start [number of nodes]

To stop the cluster:

   ./opensaf.sh stop

To (warm) restart the cluster:

   ./opensaf.sh restart [number of nodes]


COMMAND LINE INTERFACE (CLI)

To access the opensaf CLI, first switch to the super user using the 'su' command.
Then start the CLI with: 'ncs_cli_maa'. Online help is provided and to exit the
CLI use the command 'clishut'.
