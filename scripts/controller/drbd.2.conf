  As you can see, you can also comment chunks of text
  with a 'skip[optional nonsense]{ skipped text }' section.
  This comes in handy, if you just want to comment out
  some 'resource <some name> {...}' section:
  just precede it with 'skip'.

  The basic format of option assignment is
  <option name><linear whitespace><value>;

  It should be obvious from the examples below,
  but if you really care to know the details:

  <option name> :=
        valid options in the respective scope
  <value>  := <num>|<string>|<choice>|...
              depending on the set of allowed values
              for the respective option.
  <num>    := [0-9]+, sometimes with an optional suffix of K,M,G
  <string> := (<name>|\"([^\"\\\n]*|\\.)*\")+
  <name>   := [/_.A-Za-z0-9-]+
