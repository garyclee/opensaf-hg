This directory contains an AMF component sample implementation.

amf_comp_template.c contains the skeleton of an AMF
component. All required callbacks are implemented and responds OK when
requested. To be used with with any of the configuration files mentioned below.
This implementation can be used as a starting point to see what happens when you
do admin operations such as lock, lock-instantiation etc on SU or any other level
containing the component.

Loggin output is done to the system log (normally /var/log/message).

Appconfig-2N.xml: This file contains the AMF model for an application running in
a 2N redundancy model. The amf_demo is configured to run on
the 2 controllers.
 
Appconfig-nwayactive.xml: This file contains the AMF model for an application running
in an NWayActive redundancy model. The configuration contains 5 SUs that will run on
the "allnodes" AMF node group.

Note that the SU admin state has no value which means default => UNLOCKED. This means
that AMF will automatically instantiate and assign the components.

Note that AMF does not support runtime addition of UNLOCKED SUs. Therefore the model
needs to be merged offline before starting OpenSAF. This can be done with the 
immxml-merge tool.
