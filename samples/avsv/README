This directory contains two different AMF component implementations:
	1) amf_demo.c 
	2) amf_comp_template.c

amf_demo.c tries to cover all functions in the AMF API and will exit after a few
health checks to demonstrate fail over. Must be used with the 2N configuration
file.

amf_comp_template.c on the other hand contains just the skeleton of an AMF
component. All required callbacks are implemented and responds OK when
requested. To be used with with any of the configuration files. Use this
implementation if you are interested in what happens when you do admin operations
such as lock, lock-instantiation etc on SU or any other level containing the 
component.

Both implementations will output to the system log (normally /var/log/message).
