This is the README file for the PLMc config directory.

This directory consists of the following files:

plmc.conf
  A sample plmc.conf file.  A custom version of this file needs to be
  installed in /etc/opensaf, or the PLMc environment variables need
  to be set in the OpenSAF script.conf file.  See the PLMc scripts
  directory for details.  Please note well: The plmc.conf file has a
  tag for the ee_id.  This ee_id must be unique for the given cluster
  node.  If the ee_id value is duplicated across cluster nodes, the
  PLMc library will not function correctly.
