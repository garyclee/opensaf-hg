To Compile the library 
  See top README
  The library is called libplmc_lib.so and will end up in the lib directory

  Also note: The plmc_d daemon is built with DEBUG messages turned off:
    CFLAGS=-g -Wall -fpic

  If you want to turn on debug messages, use:
    CFLAGS=-g -Wall -fpic -DPLMC_LIB_DEBUG
  Additional debug messages will show up in /tmp/plmc_lib_debug.<pid>.

Test executable
  When compiled from top you will also end up with a test/test_lib executable.
  This is a small test program that simulates a PLMSv - and exercises the PLMc
  library function calls.  It gives you a console-based user interface which
  can be used to issue commands, using the library.  Note: Do not run test_lib
  at the same time as the plmc_tcp_talker, which is another test program that
  tests a single connection to a PLMc daemon.

Running test executable
  Before you can use this program you will need to export the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  to point to where you put to the libplmc_lib.so file.  Note that this
  is not needed if the library is installed in the system wide library path.
  An example of how to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you are in the same directory
  as the libplmc_lib.so could be.

  # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD

  The test_lib program needs a plmc.conf file.  You can put that where ever
  you want.  You will need to set the environment variable
  PLMC_CONF_PATH to reflect where it is located.  If PLMC_CONF_PATH is not set,
  the library will assume /etc/opensaf/plmc.conf.  If it can't find a 
  conf file there either, the library will return an error during
  initialization.
