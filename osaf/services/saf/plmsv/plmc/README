This is the main README file for the PLMc library and daemon.

This directory consists of the following directory and files:

bin
  This is where the binary executables are placed.

config
  This is where the plmc.conf file is placed.

inc
  All include files are found here, including the public include
  file for the PLMc library: plmc_lib.h

lib
  This is where some object files (.o) and dynamic link
  libraries (.so) are placed.

Makefile
  A simple Makefile for making the PLMc library and daemon.
  It includes the targets: all, clean.
  Note: This Makefile does not provide an install target, as
  the installation should be provided when PLMc is integrated
  with an OpenSAF source repository.
  After making, to manually install PLMc:

    cp bin/* /usr/bin
    cp inc/plmc_lib.h /usr/include/opensaf 
    cp lib/*.so /usr/lib/opensaf
    cp scripts/plmc_boot scripts/plmc_main /etc/init.d
    cd /etc/init.d
    chkconfig --add ./plmc_boot
    chkconfig --add ./plmc_main 
    cp config/plmc.conf /etc/opensaf  # Customize plmc.conf file for your cluster.
                                      # Make sure the ee_id is unique for the node.

plmc_d
  This is where the PLMc daemon is built.

plmc_lib
  This is where the PLMc library is built.

scripts
  This is where the RC init programs for the PLMc daemon are placed,
  as well as instructions on how to modify the OpenSAF script.conf.in
  file to include path environment variables needed by the PLMc
  library and daemon.

test
  This is where binary executable test programs are placed.
