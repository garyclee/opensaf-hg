            "A reference to MIB definitions specific to the particular
            media being used to realize the interface.  It is
            recommended that this value point to an instance of a MIB
            object in the media-specific MIB, i.e., that this object
            have the semantics associated with the InstancePointer
            textual convention defined in RFC 2579.  In fact, it is
            recommended that the media-specific MIB specify what value
            ifSpecific should/can take for values of ifType.  If no MIB
            definitions specific to the particular media are available,
            the value should be set to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }."
